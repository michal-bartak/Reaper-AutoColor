"""Generate the placeholder images the docs reference, for shots nobody has taken yet.

Every screenshot in these docs is taken by hand -- the window is a ReaImGui script inside
REAPER, so there is nothing to drive from CI. SHOTS below is therefore the list of what the
pages expect: each entry names the file, and the caption is a note-to-self about what the
real screenshot has to show.

Running this writes a labelled grey card for every entry that does NOT exist yet, so the
site builds and every missing shot is obvious on the page. It never overwrites an existing
file, so dropping a real screenshot in at the same path is all it takes to replace one.
Pass --force to redraw the placeholders anyway (it still refuses to touch anything that is
not a placeholder of ours -- see is_placeholder).

    python3 scripts/placeholders.py            # fill in what is missing
    python3 scripts/placeholders.py --status    # list what is still a placeholder
