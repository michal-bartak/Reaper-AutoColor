// REAPER toolbar icons are a 3-state horizontal strip of square cells. Measuring all 528 shipped
// strips in Data/toolbar_icons tells you what the cells mean, because their colours are consistent:
//
//   cell 1  #818989 (53% of opaque pixels)  normal
//   cell 2  #939A9A (50%)                   the same art, ~14% lighter -- hover
//   cell 3  #1ABC98 (50%)                   the theme accent -- drawn while a toggle is ARMED
//
// So cell 3 is not a momentary click flash; it is how REAPER shows that a toggle action is on.
// That is what lets the AutoToggle button say whether the background loop is running:
//
//   off      the star greyed to REAPER's own #818989, so it reads as inactive next to every
//            other idle button on the toolbar
//   hover    that grey lifted 14%, exactly as REAPER lifts its own
//   on       the full six colours -- the mark only pays out its colour while it is working
//
// The window button is not a toggle, so it keeps its colours throughout and merely brightens.
