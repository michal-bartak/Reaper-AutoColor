title: Rules file
description: Where the rule set lives, what is in it, and how it is protected
---

One global rule set is shared by every project:

```
<REAPER resource path>/MXM_AutoColor/config.json
```

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/REAPER/MXM_AutoColor/config.json` |
| Windows | `%AppData%\REAPER\AutoColor\config.json` |
| Linux | `~/.config/REAPER/MXM_AutoColor/config.json` |

*Options → Show REAPER resource path in explorer/finder* opens the parent directory. The path is
also printed in the **Rules file** section of [Options](/Reaper-AutoColor/configuration/).

:::note[Why it is not in `Scripts/`]
It sits deliberately **outside** the script folder, so reinstalling or updating the scripts cannot
destroy your rules.

## The files beside it

| File | When it appears |
|---|---|
| `config.bak.json` | The previous version, kept on every save and before a migration. |
| `config.bad.json` | An unreadable file, parked rather than lost. The tool then starts from defaults and says so. |

## What is in it

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "options": {
    "propagate_folders": "fill_unmatched",
    "subfolder_splits_range": true,
    "clear_unmatched": { "track": false, "item": true, "region": false, "marker": false },
    "auto_undo": false,
    "tick_interval": 0.2,
    "cold_budget_ms": 4,
    "cold_interval": 5,
    "font_size": 14
  },
  "rules": {
    "track":  [ { "label": "Bass", "mode": "regex", "pattern": "^(sub )?bass", "color": 8142034 } ],
    "item":   [],
    "region": [],
    "marker": []
  }
}
```

`rules` holds one ordered list per kind, and the order **is** the precedence.

### Rule fields

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `label` | The rule's name in the window. |
| `enabled` | `false` switches the rule off without deleting it. |
| `mode` | `substring`, `glob` or `regex`. **contains** in the window is `substring` here. |
| `pattern` | What to match. Empty means "match on the filter alone". |
| `ci` | Ignore case (ASCII only) — the **Aa** column. `true` unless you say otherwise. |
| `only` | The filter: `folder`, `children`, `unnamed`, or absent. |
| `color`, `color2` | The rule's colour, and the second colour that makes a gradient. `0xRRGGBB` as a decimal number — `8142034` is `#7C3CD2`. |
| `gradient_scope` | `all`, `run`, `folder` or `both`. |
| `cascade_items` | Track rules: also colour the items on the matched tracks. |
| `note` | A message the tool has attached to the rule, e.g. why it was disabled on load. |
| `id` | Internal identity, used to follow a rule across reorders. Leave it alone. |
| `invert` | Match everything the pattern does **not** match. Honoured by the engine, with no control in the window — a file-only field. |

## Editing it by hand

Close the configuration window first. The window holds the rule set in memory and writes it back as
you edit, so changes made underneath it are overwritten.

:::tip
Keep a copy of a rule set you like. The file is plain JSON, so it diffs and merges cleanly, and it is
the whole configuration — copying it to another machine is the entire "sync" story.

## Version handling

`version` is the schema version, and it is what makes upgrading safe in both directions:

- An **older** file is migrated on load, with the previous file kept as `config.bak.json`. The
  single-list layout becomes one list per kind, preserving relative order within each kind — see
  [Upgrading](/Reaper-AutoColor/installation/#upgrading-from-the-single-list-version).
- A **newer** file is loaded read-only. The window shows a banner, editing is allowed, and nothing
  is saved — so an older build cannot quietly rewrite a config it does not understand.

A rule using a feature this build has dropped is **disabled** on load, with the reason in its `note`,
rather than silently losing the setting.
