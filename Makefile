# The scripts themselves need no build step -- REAPER runs the .lua files where they sit. This
# file is for the parts that do have a toolchain: the test suite, the icon, and the docs site.

# Defined up here because the icon target needs it too, and Make expands a prerequisite the moment
# it reads the rule -- a definition further down would expand to nothing.

# Screenshots. Every figure references a real .png under docs/src/assets, so replacing one is
# "overwrite the file, rebuild" -- no markdown edit. Files not captured yet hold a generated
# placeholder naming itself, so the build never breaks on a missing shot. Drawing them needs
# Pillow (pip3 install Pillow); without it this is a no-op and the committed ones still build.
#   docs-shots         draw placeholders for any newly referenced image (runs on dev/build too)
#   docs-shots-status  list which screenshots are real and which are still placeholders
# The colouring diagrams under docs/src/assets/usage/diagrams are GENERATED, not drawn:
# scripts/diagrams.py computes every square from a port of lib/apply.lua. Redrawing on
# every docs build is cheap (no dependencies) and keeps an edited scenario from shipping
# stale. `--verify` diffs the port against the real apply.lua and needs lua, so it is a
# separate target rather than a build prerequisite.
