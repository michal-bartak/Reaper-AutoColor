--[[
  rules.lua -- the rule record.

  A rule belongs to exactly one object kind, decided by which list it lives in
  (see config.lua). That is why there is no "targets" field any more: a rule in
  the track list colours tracks, full stop. It removes a whole class of
  confusion, like a region rule offering an "is a folder track" filter.

  Rules arrive from three places (the GUI, the config file, the starter set) and
  all three go through normalise(), so the rest of the code can assume every
  field is present and of the right type.
