  targets.lua -- the only module that knows how REAPER stores names and colours.

  Everything else works on plain entry tables (track icons: see icons.lua):

    { kind    = 'track'|'item'|'region'|'marker',
      obj     = the REAPER object (or marker index bundle),
      name    = string,          -- '' when unnamed
      guid    = string,          -- stable identity for the auto-loop cache
      color   = number,          -- raw I_CUSTOMCOLOR reading, un-normalised
      -- tracks only:
      folderdepth = number, depth = number, idx = number,
      spacer_above = boolean,    -- a REAPER visual spacer sits above it
      icon = string,             -- P_ICON as read: absolute, or '' for none
      instrument, midi_in, bus = boolean,   -- for the filters
      -- items only:
      track_guid = string,       -- which track it sits on, for the cascade
      -- any kind:
      context = true }           -- present for context only; never written to

  Marker/region note: reading uses EnumProjectMarkers3 and writing uses
  SetProjectMarker4. Both are long-stable. The 7.62+ GetRegionOrMarker family is
  used for three things -- CLEARING a colour (SetProjectMarker4 treats colour 0
  as "leave unchanged" and so physically cannot clear), reading B_UISEL, and
  reading a marker's GUID. All of them are guarded by APIExists with a graceful
  fallback.

  That GUID matters more than it looks. The fallback identity is index+position,
  so nudging a region used to change who it was, which lost the auto-loop's
  memory that its colour had been picked by hand -- and leaked a cache entry per
  move. "GUID" is read-only on GetSetRegionOrMarkerInfo_String and is what a
  marker keeps across a move.

------------------------------------------------------------------- tracks
--- Every track, in project order, with folder depth tracked as we go.
--- ALL tracks are always returned. Under `selected_only` the unselected ones
--- come back flagged `context = true`: the apply pipeline uses them for folder
--- inheritance and track->item cascade but never writes to them. Without that,
--- "apply to selection" inside a folder would get the inherited colour wrong.
-- @param opts { selected_only = bool }
-- The master track is deliberately NOT enumerated: REAPER does not honour a
-- custom colour on it, so colouring it is not something this tool can do.
--- Which selection did the user actually mean?
---
--- A track selection and an item selection can both be live at once -- select
--- a track, then click some items, and the track selection just sits there.
--- REAPER answers this for its own "...depending on focus" actions with the
--- cursor context, so do the same rather than inventing a rule.
---
--- Measured, not assumed (MXM_AutoColor_FocusProbe.lua): GetCursorContext()
--- is useless from a script -- it reported "unknown" (-1) on every single run,
--- because the running action is not the arrange view. GetCursorContext2 with
--- want_last_valid keeps the last real answer and tracked clicks correctly.
---
--- The counts are checked BEFORE the context, and that ordering matters: the
--- context goes stale. The probe caught a run reading "items" with zero items
--- selected, which would otherwise have coloured nothing at all.
---
--- Markers and regions are a separate axis and are always honoured when
--- selected: the cursor context has no value for them (0/1/2 are track panels,
--- items and envelopes), so there is nothing to arbitrate with. A marker
--- selection left over from earlier cannot be told from a deliberate one.
---
--- How many markers/regions are selected. There is no CountSelectedMarkers,
--- so this enumerates; it runs on a button press, never in the auto loop.
