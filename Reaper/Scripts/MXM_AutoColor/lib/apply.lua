  apply.lua -- plan / prune / commit.

  Every entry point shares this pipeline, including the GUI's live preview,
  which is just plan() with no commit. Keeping planning pure (it reads entry
  tables and writes nothing) is what makes the preview honest: what it shows is
  literally what Apply would do.

    plan(entries, rules, options) -> ops     no REAPER writes
    commit(ops, desc, options)               the only place that writes

  plan() already drops no-ops, so an unchanged project produces zero ops, which
  in turn means no writes, no undo point, and no project-dirty flag. That is the
  precondition for the auto-apply loop being cheap.
