  autoloop.lua -- the background engine behind the auto-apply toggle.

  Cost model, which is the whole design:

    * Idle (nothing changed): three API calls per tick. Nothing else runs.
    * A change: tracks are enumerated immediately, because renames almost always
      happen to a track and that is where the user is looking. They are only
      PLANNED when that enumeration differs from the last one. REAPER has a
      single project-wide change counter, so a fader move arrives looking
      exactly like a rename; comparing the enumeration is what tells them apart,
      and planning is the expensive half.
    * Items and markers are swept once the project has settled, and only when
      something says they need it: a change in how many there are, a track that
      really did change, a rule edit, or the slow safety net below.
    * That sweep is COMMITTED in time-budgeted chunks across subsequent ticks.
      Enumerating and planning happen once per sweep rather than per chunk, so
      gradients still see the whole list -- chunking splits the writing, not the
      thinking.

  The safety net exists because one edit is invisible to every cheap signal:
  renaming an item in place adds nothing, removes nothing and touches no track.
  So a sweep that was declined stays PENDING and runs anyway once
  `cold_interval` has passed -- from the idle path if need be, since the project
  need not change again for the rename to still be waiting. Setting the option
  to 0 declines nothing and sweeps on every change, which is what this did
  before the gate existed.

  Three things stop the loop from being obnoxious:

    * The project change counter is re-read AFTER writing, so our own edits do
      not trigger another sweep.
    * If an object's colour differs from what we last wrote while its name is
      unchanged, the user recoloured it by hand. It is marked as overridden and
      left alone until it is renamed. Without this the tool would revert every
      manual colour within a fifth of a second. A track's icon is tracked the
      same way, separately: a hand-picked icon does not stop its colour.
    * "What we last wrote" means exactly that. A write that failed, or one still
      sitting in the queue, is not remembered as ours -- otherwise the next
      sweep reads the difference as a hand-picked colour and quietly retires the
      object from the rules for good.
